# Humanoid Robot Control System

## Overview

The **Humanoid Robot Control System** project aims to develop a control interface and underlying architecture for managing the movement and behavior of a humanoid robot. The system will allow real-time control over the robot's various components such as limbs, joints, and sensors, enabling the execution of complex tasks.

## Features

- **Real-Time Control**: The system allows precise control over each joint of the robot.
- **Kinematic Control**: Supports forward and inverse kinematics for natural movement.
- **Sensor Integration**: Real-time sensor data feedback (e.g., gyroscopes, accelerometers) for balance and environment awareness.
- **Autonomous and Manual Modes**: Option for both manual control via a user interface and semi-autonomous task execution.
- **Path Planning**: Pathfinding algorithms to navigate the environment safely.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error detection and recovery systems.

## System Architecture

1. **User Interface (UI)**:

   - A graphical interface for manually controlling robot movements.
   - Control inputs for joint manipulation, walking, arm movements, etc.

2. **Control Algorithms**:

   - **Kinematics**: Calculates appropriate joint angles based on desired end-effector positions.
   - **Trajectory Planning**: Smooth movement between waypoints.
   - **Stabilization**: Uses sensor data to maintain balance.

3. **Hardware Integration**:
   - Interfaces with the robot’s motors, sensors, and power management units.
   - Communicates via communication protocols such as UART, CAN bus, or wireless modules.

## Requirements

### Software:

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries**:
  - Robotics Toolbox
  - OpenCV (for vision)
  - ROS (Robot Operating System)
  - NumPy

### Hardware:

- Humanoid robot with motorized joints.
- Sensors: Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Lidar (optional for navigation).
- Communication Module (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Humanoid_Robot_Control_System.git
   ```

2. **UI Access**:
   - Use the provided graphical interface to control robot movements in real-time.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more autonomous features such as object recognition.
- Improve the robot’s learning capability using machine learning algorithms.
- Implement full-body motion capture.
